Borealis - The Binary Outcast Navigator
===============================================================================

Borealis is a web browsing application forked from Mozilla community code that
is built using the Unified XUL Platform (UXP).

* https://github.com/MoonchildProductions/uxp

Its user interface is similar to the SeaMonkey's Navigator/Browser component
which was dirived from the Mozilla Application Suite developed largely by
Netscape for Netscape Communicator 6/7.

This does NOT include the MailNews, Composer, or any other suite bundled
components.
